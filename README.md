app to purchase anything from well-known local vendors

I led a team of four developers for three months for creation of this app.

An app built using Flutter using Firebase backend. This app has features for local vendors (MSMEs) to put their products catalogue online. Simultaneously, it has features for users / buyers to place orders from nearby vendors.
